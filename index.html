   <b>And he was walking in the garden<br>
And he was walking in the night<br>
And he was singing a sad love song<br>
And he was praying for his life<br>
And the stars came out around him<br>
He was thinking of his sins<br>
And he's looking at his song-bird<br>
And he's looking at his wings<br>
There inside the garden<br>
Came another with his lips<br>
Said, 'Won't you come and be my lover?'<br>
'Let me give you a little kiss'<br>
And he came, knelt down before him<br>
And fell upon his knees<br>
Said, 'I will give you gold and mountains<br>
If you stay awhile with me'<br>
And there was trouble taking place.<br>
There inside the garden<br>
They kissed, and the sun rose<br>
And he walked a little further<br>
And he found he was alone<br>
And the wind, it gathered round him<br>
He was thinking of his sins<br>
He was looking at his song-bird<br>
And he was looking at his wings<br>
And there was trouble taking place.<br>
